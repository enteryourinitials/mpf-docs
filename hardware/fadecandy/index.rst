MPF allows you to use a FadeCandy LED controller to drive the LEDs in
your pinball machine. A FadeCandy is a small, cheap ($25) USB
controller which can drive up to 512 serially-controlled RGB LEDs.

.. image:: /hardware/images/fadecandy.jpg

You can use the FadeCandy in place of connecting your LEDs to a P-ROC/P3-ROC
controller, or you can choose to drive some LEDs via your primary pinball
controller and some via the FadeCandy. (This is useful if you want to use more
LEDs than what your controller platform supports.)

You can connect up to four FadeCandy boards to drive a total of 2048 LEDs
(Which would be insane. And awesome.)

You can read more about the FadeCandy on the main page of the
`FadeCandy software repository <https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy>`_ in
GitHub or on `Adafruit <http://www.adafruit.com/products/1689>`_ or
`SparkFun <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12821>`_, where you can
buy one for $25. The FadeCandy is very advanced, offering
advanced light processing capabilities such as dithering and interpolation that
are not available if you just control LEDs directly.

1. Understanding all the parts and pieces
-----------------------------------------

Before we dig in to setting up a FadeCandy with MPF, let's look at how all the
various components will fit together:

* The FadeCandy is a piece of hardware that talks to your host
  computer via USB. (So if you use it in a pinball machine then you'll
  have two devices connected via USBâ€”your pinball controller and your
  FadeCandy.)
* The FadeCandy hardware is driven a FadeCandy server software that
  you'll run on your host computer along side the MPF game engine and
  the MPF media controller. The FadeCandy server talks to the FadeCandy
  hardware via a USB driver.
* The FadeCandy server receives instructions for LEDs connected to the
  FadeCandy via a protocol called `Open Pixel Control <http://openpixelcontrol.org/>`_
  (OPC).

Putting it all together, MPF talks to the FadeCandy server via OPC, and the
FadeCandy server talks to the FadeCandy hardware via USB.

2. Download the FadeCandy package from GitHub
---------------------------------------------

The first step is to download the `FadeCandy package <https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy/releases/latest>`_
from GitHub. You can unzip it to wherever you want.

3. Install the FadeCandy drivers
--------------------------------

When I (Brian) plugged the FadeCandy hardware into my Windows
computer, the driver did not install automatically. Running the
fcserver (next step) said it was installing the drivers, but that
didn't do anything for me. (It just said "this may take awhile" but I
killed it when it didn't seem like it was actually doing anything.)

In my case, I googled and found `this procedure <http://www.libusb.org/wiki/winusb_driver_installation>`_
to build custom .inf files for Windows. It seems crazy but it wasn't too bad. I
had to build two: One for the FadeCandy device and one for the FadeCandy boot
loader. Either way, you can follow the docs and the forums around the
FadeCandy and get it setup.

4. Setup the fcserver
---------------------

The FadeCandy download package includes pre-built binaries for Mac and
Windows. On Linux you can compile it. Again, the FadeCandy documentation has
details about how to do this.

At this point you should be able to run the fcserver and to talk to your
FadeCandy LEDs and get them to do things. There are a bunch of sample apps in
the FadeCandy package that are kind of cool.

5. Set your LEDs to use the "fadecandy" platform
------------------------------------------------

Next you need to configure your LEDs in MPF to use the ``fadecandy`` platform.
By default, all types of devices are assumed to be using the same platform that
you have set in the :doc:`/config/hardware` of your machine config file. So if
your platform is set to ``fast``, MPF assumes your LEDs are connected to a FAST
controller, and if your platform is set to ``p_roc`` or ``p3_roc``, MPF assumes
your LEDs are connected to a PD-LED board.

To configure MPF to use FadeCandy LEDs, you can add an entry to the
``hardware:`` section of your machine config to tell it to override the default
platform for your LEDs and to instead use the ``fadecandy`` platform, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    hardware:
      platform: p_roc
      driverboards: pdb
      lights: fadecandy

See the :doc:`/hardware/platform` guide for more information about setting
device-specific default platforms versus overriding the platform for individual
devices.

6. Understanding FadeCandy LED numbering
----------------------------------------

The FadeCandy hardware has 8 connectors for LEDs, each of which can
support up to 64 RGB LEDs (for 512 RGB LEDs total). The connectors are
numbered 0-7.

The individual LED numbers are sequential across channels. The
first LED on Connector 0 is #0, the second is #1, etc., up #63 on
Connector 0. Then Connector 1 picks up where Connector 0 leaves off, with
the first LED on Connector 2 being #64, and so on. The FadeCandy
doesn't actually know how many LEDs are connected to each connector,
so the first LED on Connector 1 is always LED #64 even if you have less
than 64 LEDs physically connected to Connector 0.

The following diagram explains how the numbering works:

.. image:: /hardware/images/fadecandy_numbering.jpg

Consider the following config:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   lights:
     l_led0:
       number: 0    # first LED on connector 0
     l_led1:
       number: 1    # second LED on connector 0
     l_led2:
       number: 128    # first LED on connector 2

(If you're familiar with the Open Pixel Control protocol, all of the LEDs on a
single FadeCandy board are on the same OPC channel, which is technically what
you're specifying with the number before the dash.)

6a. Numbering with multiple channels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also assign different OSC channels to your connectors.
This has certain performance advantages and allows nicer numbering.

Start your fadecandy server with the following config:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "listen": ["127.0.0.1", 7890],
       "verbose": true,
       "color": {
           "gamma": 2.5,
           "whitepoint": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
       },
       "devices": [
           {
               "type": "fadecandy",
               "serial": "YOUR_FADECANDY_SERIAL",
               "map": [
                   [ 0, 0, 0, 64 ],
                   [ 1, 0, 64, 64 ],
                   [ 2, 0, 128, 64 ],
                   [ 3, 0, 192, 64 ],
                   [ 4, 0, 256, 64 ],
                   [ 5, 0, 320, 64 ],
                   [ 6, 0, 384, 64 ],
                   [ 7, 0, 448, 64 ]
               ]
           },
       ]
   }

Replace `YOUR_FADECANDY_SERIAL` with the serial of your fadecandy.
The serial will be shown on the console of `fcserver` when connecting your
fadecandy.

Then configure your lights as follows:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   lights:
     l_led0_0:
       number: 0-0    # first LED on connector 0
     l_led1_0:
       number: 1-0    # first LED on connector 1
     l_led1_1:
       number: 1-1    # second LED on connector 1
     l_led7_20:
       number: 7-20    # twentyth LED on connector 7

6b. Numbering with multiple Fadecandy Boards
--------------------------------------------

If you want to use multiple FadeCandy boards we suggest the following config:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "listen": ["127.0.0.1", 7890],
       "verbose": true,
       "color": {
           "gamma": 2.5,
           "whitepoint": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
       },
       "devices": [
           {
               "type": "fadecandy",
               "serial": "YOUR_FADECANDY_SERIAL1",
               "map": [
                   [ 0, 0, 0, 64 ],
                   [ 1, 0, 64, 64 ],
                   [ 2, 0, 128, 64 ],
                   [ 3, 0, 192, 64 ],
                   [ 4, 0, 256, 64 ],
                   [ 5, 0, 320, 64 ],
                   [ 6, 0, 384, 64 ],
                   [ 7, 0, 448, 64 ]
               ]
           },
           {
               "type": "fadecandy",
               "serial": "YOUR_FADECANDY_SERIAL2",
               "map": [
                   [ 8, 0, 0, 64 ],
                   [ 9, 0, 64, 64 ],
                   [ 10, 0, 128, 64 ],
                   [ 11, 0, 192, 64 ],
                   [ 12, 0, 256, 64 ],
                   [ 13, 0, 320, 64 ],
                   [ 14, 0, 384, 64 ],
                   [ 15, 0, 448, 64 ]
               ]
           },
           {
               "type": "fadecandy",
               "serial": "YOUR_FADECANDY_SERIAL3",
               "map": [
                   [ 16, 0, 0, 64 ],
                   [ 17, 0, 64, 64 ],
                   [ 18, 0, 128, 64 ],
                   [ 19, 0, 192, 64 ],
                   [ 20, 0, 256, 64 ],
                   [ 21, 0, 320, 64 ],
                   [ 22, 0, 384, 64 ],
                   [ 23, 0, 448, 64 ]
               ]
           }
       ]
   }

Replace `YOUR_FADECANDY_SERIAL1`, `YOUR_FADECANDY_SERIAL2` and
`YOUR_FADECANDY_SERIAL3` with the serials of your fadecandy boards
(you can use more or less than three).
The serial will be shown on the console of `fcserver` when connecting your
fadecandy.

Afterwards, configure your lights as follows:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   lights:
     l_led0_0:
       number: 0-0    # first LED on connector 0 on board 0
     l_led1_0:
       number: 1-0    # first LED on connector 1 on board 0
     l_led1_1:
       number: 1-1    # second LED on connector 1 on board 0
     l_led7_20:
       number: 7-20    # twentyth LED on connector 7 on board 0
     l_led8_0:
       number: 8-0    # first LED on connector 0 on board 1
     l_led8_1:
       number: 8-63    # last LED on connector 1 on board 1
     l_led17_1:
       number: 17-1    # second LED on connector 1 on board 2

7. Unterstanding MPF light numbers and channels
-----------------------------------------------

.. include:: /mechs/lights/include_channels_numbers.rst

Fadecandy assumes RGB lights by default.
For everything else (i.e. RGBW) you have to use channels.

Light Numbers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fadecandy numbers use the format: ``osc_channel``-``number``

If you mapped OSC channels as described in (6b/c) set them as
``osc_channel``.
``number`` is the index of your light in the chain.

Internally, Fadecandy assumes three channels per LED (RGB/GRB
:doc:`WS2811/WS2812 LEDs </mechs/lights/ws2812>`).

Channels
^^^^^^^^

Fadecandy channels use the format: ``osc_channel``-``channel_index``

``channel_index`` is ``number * 3``.
This is because serial LEDs are traditionally RGB (or GRB) LEDs with exactly
three channels.
However, this is not true for RGBW or similar LEDs which do not work with this
style of numbering.
Luckily, you can chain them instead and have MPF calculate the internal
channels for you:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    lights:
      led_0:
        start_channel: 0-0
        subtype: led
        type: rgb    # will use red: 0-0, green: 0-1, blue: 0-2
      led_1:
        previous: led_0
        subtype: led
        type: rgbw   # will use red: 0-3, green: 0-4, blue: 0-5, white: 0-6
      led_2:
        previous: led_1
        subtype: led
        type: rgbw   # will use red: 0-7, green: 0-8, blue: 0-9, white: 0-10

See :doc:`/mechs/lights/ws2812` for details.

8. Launch the fcserver
----------------------

In order for MPF to communicate with the FadeCandy, the fcserver has to be
running. Refer to the FadeCandy documentation for instructions for this. On
Windows, for example, it's just called ``fcserver.exe``.

There are several command line options you can use with the server, though you
don't need any of them with MPF unless you have more than one FadeCandy board
connected.

You should launch fcserver in its own window since it will take over the
console when it's running. It's also safe to keep it running all the time, or
you can add it to a batch file to run it automatically. On my system, the
fcserver puts some error message on the screen about not being able to connect
to something, but everything still works even with that message continually
being written to the console. (I think it's something to do with the P-ROC's
FTDI driver? It only comes up when the P-ROC is on.)


9. Additional FadeCandy LED options
-----------------------------------

The FadeCandy hardware supports some advanced options which are configured in
the :doc:`/config/fadecandy` section of your machine configuration file.
Specifically, you can set the keyframe interpolation, dithering, gamma, white
point, linear slope, and linear cutoff. The defaults should be fine for almost
everyone, though you can go nuts if you want.

10. Color Correction
--------------------

If you are using RGB LEDs, they might not be perfectly white when you turn
them on. They might be pinkish or blueish instead depending on the brand of
the LED. To a certain extend this is normal/expected and you can compensate
for it by configuring
:doc:`hardware color correction in the fadecandy </config/fadecandy>`.
If you need more than one correction profile (e.g. for multiple LED models)
you need to fall back to
:doc:`software color_correction profiles in light_settings </config/light_settings>`.
Hardware correction should be preferred and give you much more dynamic range.

What if it did not work?
