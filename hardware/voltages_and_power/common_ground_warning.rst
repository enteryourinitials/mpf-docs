.. warning::

   Please ensure that you have established
   :doc:`common ground between logic and coil power </hardware/voltages_and_power/voltages_and_power>`
   before turning on high voltage on your coils (especially on homebrew machines).
   Ignoring this might lock on your coils, overheat them, burn down your house or kill you.
   We are serious, floating grounds are dangerous.
   If you are not an electrical engineer read the
   :doc:`guide about voltages and power </hardware/voltages_and_power/index>`.

   In a nutshell: You need to connect your logic ground (5V/12V) and your high
   voltage ground (48V or 80V).
   A :doc:`power entry or power filter board </hardware/voltages_and_power/index>`
   is a convenient solution to solve this (and more) issues.

   Always turn all PSUs off when connecting power or you might fry all boards
   at once.
   This is generally a good idea but even more important when connecting more
   than one power supply to a board.

   IF YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS WARNING MEANS STOP NOW AND TRY TO
   UNDERSTAND IT.
   OTHERWISE YOUR HARDWARE WILL LIKELY BURST INTO FLAMES AND YOU NEED TO WAIT A
   FEW DAYS FOR A REPLACEMENT OR EVEN WORSE IT MIGHT KILL YOU.
   IGNORING THIS IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE FOR BROKEN DRIVER BOARDS.
