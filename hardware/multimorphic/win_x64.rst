How to install P-ROC / P3-ROC drivers on Windows (64-bit)
=========================================================

This guide explains how to install the USB drivers for the P-ROC or P3-ROC on
64-bit Windows (x64).

1. Download and install the FTDI drivers
----------------------------------------

The P-ROC and P3-ROC boards use a chip from a company called "FTDI Chip" to
handle the USB communication, so you need to install the FTDI driver so Windows
can properly see the device when you plug it in.

You can download the latest version from here:

http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm

Here's a screen shot of the download section of that page. Note that the actual
version number of the driver might be newer that the screen shot below. That
should be ok.

Download and run the setup executable from the "1" link in the screen shot.

2. Now download and unzip the other package
-------------------------------------------

Next you need to download the other package (from the "2" link in the screen
shot) which is a zip file.

Unzip it and find the file called ``ftd2xx64.dll``. (Probably in the ``amd64``
folder.)

Copy it to ``C:\Windows\System32``

Rename it from ``ftd2xx64.dll`` to ``ftd2xx.dll``

Now MPF will be able to communicate with the P-ROC or P3-ROC.

Continue on with the :doc:`platform` documentation to finish your MPF
configuration for the P-ROC/P3-ROC.

3. Install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019
------------------------------------------------------------

You might already have those but in case you do not install
`Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 (64-bit) <https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe>`_.
