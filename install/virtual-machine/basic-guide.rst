Basic Guide
===========



Prerequisites
-------------

-  Comfortability with running Linux commands

-  Basic knowlege of SSH

-  Host OS with VirtualBox 5+ installed and 10 GB+ of free space

-  Internet Connection (Only required for Debian install)



Setting up new VirtualBox machine
---------------------------------

1. In VirtualBox Manager, start a new machine.

   -  Name: Choose a name for your VM. This is the name that will be
      used in VirtualBox.

   -  Machine Folder: Choose a path

   -  Type: ``Linux``

   -  Version: ``Debian-64``

2. Allocate at least 1 GB (1024 MB) of RAM

3. Hard Disk:

   -  ``Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now``

4. Hard Disk File type:

   -  ``VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)``

5. Storage on physical hard disk

   -  ``Dynamically Allocated``

6. Select how much storage you want for the virtual machine. (At least
   8GB, I used 16GB.)

7. Click ``Create``

Tip: Check out the available options in the ‚öôÔ∏è ``Settings`` tab of
VirtualBox. The more accustomed you become to these options, the better
you will understand the powerful tools of VirtualBox.



Downloading Debian
------------------

1. Navigate to `the official Debian download
   site <https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst>`__.

2. Under the ``Small CDs or USB sticks`` header, click on ``amd64`` to
   download the latest version of Debian.

   (Latest Debian was 10.4.0 at time of writing)

3. An ``.iso`` file of approximately 350 MB will be downloaded.



Installing Debian
-----------------

1. Select your Mission Pinball VM from the VirtualBox GUI

2. Click the green ‚û°Ô∏è ``Start`` icon

3. If you have not yet attached the Debian ISO file to your VM, you will
   be prompted to select it now

   -  Click the üìÇ Folder icon and find your downloaded Debian.iso file:

      ``debian-10.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso``

4. Click ``Start``

5. In the virtual machine window, highlight ``Graphical Install`` and
   click enter

6. Follow the prompts to install Debian. You may need to navigate using
   the keyboard (using ``Tab`` and ``Enter``) because the VirtualBox
   Guest Additions are not yet installed. That will be done in the next
   few steps.

7. Make sure to set a root password and setup a new user of your choice.



Setting up ``sudo``
-------------------

The ``sudo`` command is required for many of the following steps of this
guide. It is likely the user that was created during the Debian install
was not granted sudo access and you will be met with this error if you
try to use sudo:

``[your-user] is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.``

To fix this:

1. Open a new terminal window

2. First change into the root user:

   -  .. code-block:: console

         su -

   -  The ``-`` is required to reset $PATH (``usermod`` may not work
      without it)

3. As root, add your username to the sudo group

   -  .. code-block:: console

         usermod -aG sudo [your-user]

4. Exit the root user shell

   -  .. code-block:: console

         exit

5. Verify your username was granted sudo access

   -  .. code-block:: console

         sudo echo

   -  A reboot may be required for sudo access to take effect



Setting up the VirtualBox Guest Additions CD 
--------------------------------------------

The VirtualBox Guest Additions provide many benefits including `but not
limited
to <https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-intro>`__:

-  Shared folders

-  Shared clipboard

-  Ability to resize the guest OS window

Full instructions for setting up the VirtualBox Guest Additions CD `can
be found
here <https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-on-debian-10/>`__.
An abbreviated version is listed below:

1. .. code-block:: console

      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)

2. (Host Window) Devices -> ‚ÄúInsert Guest Additions CD Image‚Äù

3. .. code-block:: console

      sudo mkdir -p /mnt/cdrom
      sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom

4. .. code-block:: console

      cd /mnt/cdrom
      sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run --nox11

5. Reboot

6. If necessary, confirm module is running after reboot:

   .. code-block:: console

      lsmod | grep vboxguest



Configuring network for SSH
---------------------------

Now is a good time to configure the network cards so we can SSH into the
virtual machine.

1. Create a new virtual network adapter

   1. Focus the main VirtualBox Manager window

   2. File > Host Network Manager

   3. ‚ûï ``Create``

   4. Default name is ok (``vboxnet0`` in my case)

   5. Verify subnet mask is ``255.255.255.0``

2. In VirtualBox Manager, open the settings tab for the MPF VM.

   1. Navigate to the network settings tab

   2. Click on the ``Adapter 2`` tab

   3. Enable the adapter

   4. Select ``Host Only Adapter`` as "Attached to"

   5. Name is the Virtual Network we created earlier (``vboxnet0`` in my
      case)

3. In the *host* OS, verify the VirtualBox virtual network adapter is
   connected

   -  The following is for macOS. Your command and output may look
      different

   -  .. code-block:: console

         ifconfig vboxnet0

   -  .. code-block:: console

         vboxnet0: flags=8943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
                ether 0a:00:27:00:00:00 
                inet 192.168.56.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.56.255

4. In the *guest* OS (Debian), verify the VirtualBox virtual network
   adapter is connected

   -  The following is for my installation. Your command and output may
      look different

   -  .. code-block:: console

         ip addr

   -  .. code-block:: console

         [...]
         3: enp0s8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
             link/ether 08:00:27:d8:b5:e6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
             inet 192.168.56.101/24 brd 192.168.56.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp0s8
                valid_lft 805sec preferred_lft 805sec
             inet6 fe80::e970:3c21:bf92:1f16/64 scope link noprefixroute 
                valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
         [...]

   -  Verify the IP address (``192.168.56.101`` in this case) is located
      in the same subnet as the host's IP address found earlier
      (``192.168.56.1``)

5. Verify you can SSH into the VM:

   -  .. code-block:: console

         ssh [your-user]@192.168.56.101



Installing environment tools
----------------------------

Now is a good time to install tools such as ``git`` and any other
environment tools you are accustomed with.

Verify that python is installed and using a version you expect:

.. code-block:: console

   python3 -V

``Python 3.7.3``

Install pip3 and pkg-config (which MPF needs for mpf-mc):

.. code-block:: console

   sudo apt-get install python3-pip pkg-config



Installing Mission Pinball Framework
------------------------------------

Follow the :doc:`installation
guide </install/linux/index>`
for MPF on Linux.

Basic installation:

.. code-block:: console

   pip3 install pip setuptools --upgrade

1. Clone the Debian installer

   -  .. code-block:: console

         cd ~
         git clone https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-debian-installer/
         cd mpf-debian-installer/
         chmod +x install && sudo ./install

2. Setup the mpf directory and clone examples

   -  .. code-block:: console

         cd ~
         mkdir mpf
         cd mpf
         git clone https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples

3. Run the Demo Man example. In the VBox Desktop, open terminal and
   execute:

   -  .. code-block:: console

         cd ~/mpf/mpf-examples/demo_man
         mpf both -X

   -  Verify mpf opens in terminal and mpf-mc opens in a new window.

   -  Control Keys:

      -  ``S`` - Start game

      -  ``L`` - Launch ball

      -  ``X`` - Fire slingshot

      -  ``1`` - Drain ball

      -  ``ESC`` - Close mpf-mc and quit

   -  Follow the rest of the Demo Man :doc:`example
      guide </example_games/demo_man>`.

.. warning::

	Some users have reported having trouble with OpenGL on a macOS host.

	If mpf-mc shows only a blank screen inside your VM, please `open an
	issue <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-mc/issues/new>`__.



Installing and Running MPF-Monitor
----------------------------------

The full installation guide for setting up MPF-Monitor :doc:`can be found
here </tools/monitor/installation>`.

1. Install PyQt5 (may already be installed):

   -  .. code-block:: console

         sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5

2. Install mpf-monitor:

   -  .. code-block:: console

         pip install mpf-monitor

3. Start mpf (with mc) and mpf monitor (in separate terminal tabs):

   -  .. code-block:: console

         mpf both -X

   -  .. code-block:: console

         mpf monitor

4. Adjust the size of switches and lights by adding the following to the
   first line of your ``monitor.yaml`` file:

   -  .. code:: yaml

         device_size: 0.1 

   -  More info at :doc:`MPF Monitor
      docs </tools/monitor/running>`.
