How To Build Physical Pinball Machines
======================================

This chapter is about building physical pinball machines.
If you plan to build a homebrew machine read this section and you might be able
to skip some mistakes which have been made by others before.
We try to cover most of the building part here.
A few things are elsewhere, notably
:doc:`Pinball Controll Systems </hardware/index>` and
:doc:`Pinball Mechs </mechs/index>`.

Where should you start?
If you want to create a custom layout read our
:doc:`guide on layout considerations <layout_considerations>`.
