CFE-ConfigValidator-4: Invalid Validator in config spec
=======================================================

This error occurs when MPF does not understand the config specification
for a device.
Unless you created custom config specs in a mode, (external) platform or
custom device, this is certainly a bug in MPF.
Please report this in our forum in that case!
