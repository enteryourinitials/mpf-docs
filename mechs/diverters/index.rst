In MPF, a diverter (sometimes spelled "divertor") is anything that alters
the path of the ball based on the state it's in, including:

+ A traditional diverter which is a metal flap at the end of a rod,
  typically used on ramps to "divert" the ball one way or the other.
+ A coil-controlled post that pops up (or down) to let the ball either
  pass over it or bounce back in some other direction. (This is
  sometimes called an "up/down" post.)
+ A coil-controlled gate, typically which only allows the ball to flow
  through it in a single direction, but lifted out of the way via a coil
  when active which allows the ball to travel through it in both
  directions.
+ A "trap door" pop-up which captures the ball when it's up but lets
  the ball roll over it to another shot when it's down. (Like the trap
  door / basement in Theatre of Magic.)
+ A single drop target that blocks the entrance to a shot when it's up,
  such as in the back of the saucer in Attack from Mars or the ones that
  block the ramps in Ghostbusters.
+ Something else completely custom, such as the Ringmaster in Cirqus
  Voltaire. (When it's up the ball can hit it and drop down under the
  playfield, and when it's down the ball rolls over it and hits standup
  targets behind it.)

At this point you might be thinking, "Wait, you consider a trap door
or the Ringmaster to be a diverter?? What???" But if you think about it
from the perspective of pinball software, yeah, trap doors and the
Ringmaster *are* diverters because when then are not active, a ball
shot to them goes towards one place, and when they're active, a ball is
"diverted" to go somewhere else.

.. note::

    MPF's diverters are integrated with :doc:`/mechs/ball_devices/index` and MPF's
    ball management and routing system so they can be used to ensure that MPF is
    able to move balls to where they need to be.

Most diverters are held in their "on"
position as long as their driver coil enabled, and then when they're
disabled they return back to their off position. That said, some are
different. The Ringmaster has a motor which raises and lowers it, and drop
targets have coils that are just pulsed to raise/lower them, so this is not
a hard and fast rule.

So based on all that, let's look
at how the MPF actually handles diverters. At the most basic level,
most diverters are just a coil, so fundamentally we don't really need
to do anything special to control a diverter. As a game programmer you
just need to enable a coil. But if you want to program your game code
to control a diverter, there's a lot of glue you need to fully
integrate it into your machine, and that's the glue that we've pre-
written into our diverter device code.

For example, many diverters
attached to ramps do not hold their coils in the "on" position for the
entire time that they're on. Instead they use the ramp entry switch to
see when a ball is coming their way, and when one is they quickly
activate so they can catch the ball in time to divert it. They also
typically have a timeout where they deactivate themselves if they
don't actually see a ball get diverted, (like with a weak ramp shot
that trips the ramp entry switch but that isn't powerful enough to
make it all the way up the ramp to the diverter.)

MPF's diverter devices
also include support for automatic enabling and disabling (based on
events), and they include intelligence to know which target devices a
diverter will send a ball to when it's enabled or disabled.


Understanding the difference between "enabling" and "activating" diverters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When talking about diverters in MPF, we use the terms *activate* and
*enable* (as well as *deactivate* and *disable*). Even though these
words sound like they're the same thing, they're actually different,
so it's important to understand them.

When a diverter is *active*, that
means it's physically activated in its active position. A diverter
that is *enabled* means that it's ready to be activated, but it's not
necessarily active at this time. To understand this, let's step
through an example.

Imagine a typical ramp in a pinball machine which
has one entrance and two exits. These kinds of ramps usually have a
diverter at the top of them that can send the ball down one of the two
paths. When the diverter is *inactive* (its default state), the ball
goes down one path, and when the diverter is *active*, the ball is
sent down the other path (perhaps towards a ball lock).

There is
typically an entrance switch on the ramp which lets the game know that
a ball is potentially headed towards that diverter, so when the game
wants to route the ball to the "other" ramp exit, rather than turning
on that diverter and holding it on forever, the game just watches for
that ramp entry switch and then quickly fires the diverter to route
the ball to the other exit. Then once the ball passes by the diverter,
it hits a second switch which turns off the diverter. (Typically the
diverter activation also has a timeout which is used when a weak shot
is made where the ball trips the ramp entrance switch but doesn't
actually make it all the way up the ramp to the diverter.)

So in MPF
parlance, we say that the diverter is *enabled* whenever it's ready to
be fired, but it's not actually *active* until the coil is physically
on.

Again using our example, let's say we have a ramp with a diverter,
and when that diverter is *active* it sends a ball into a lock. When
the game starts, the diverter is *disabled* and *inactive*. Ramp shots
just go up the ramp and come out the default path, and the diverter
ignores the ramp entrance switch.

Then when the player does whatever
they need to do to light the lock, the diverter is *enabled*. At this
point the diverter is *not* active since it's not actually firing, but
it's *enabled* (which means it's ready to fire) and the diverter is
watching that ramp entrance switch. (So the diverter is *enabled* but
*inactive*.) Then when the player shoots the ball up that ramp, the
diverter sees the ramp entrance switch hit and the diverter activates.
(So now the diverter is *enabled* and *active*.)

Then once the ball
passes by the diverter, the diverter deactivates. At this point
whether the diverter is disabled or enabled depends on the game logic.
If the lock should stay lit, then the diverter remains enabled even
though it's not *active*, and if the player has to do something else
to re-light the lock, then the diverter is *disabled* and *inactive*.

Hopefully that makes sense? :)

Monitorable Properties
----------------------

For :doc:`dynamic values </config/instructions/dynamic_values>` and
:doc:`conditional events </events/overview/conditional>`,
the prefix for diverters is ``device.diverters.<name>``.

*active*
   Boolean (true/false) as to whether this diverter is actively on and
   in the powered state.

*enabled*
   Boolean (true/false) as to whether this diverter is enabled (meaning
   it will be activated when a ball approaches it).

*eject_state*
   Boolean (true/false) which shows whether this diverter will be activating
   to route a ball eject from an upstream ball device.
